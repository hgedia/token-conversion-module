# Token converion

This module can be used when a payment needs to be accepted in one ERC20 currency , but the sender has a preference to use ETH. We can achieve this using the trade/conversion API's by various dApps. This repo demostrates the conversion of ETH to any of the ERC20 tokens (supported by the exchange used).

Note that , conversion from ETH to ERC20 differs from ERC20 to ERC20 in terms of flow. Hence any one attempting to use this as a base would also need to do an approve call on either of the called contracts to allow the conversion.


## Token conveter using KyberSwap 

This contract accepts ETH and converts it to any other token available in Kyber reserve. 

## Token conveter using Bancor

This contract accepts ETH and converts it to any other token available in Bancor Network.

Bancor uses a conversion path to convert from one token to another. This needs to be provided for all trade calls.

/*    
    A note on conversion path -
    Conversion path is a data structure that's used when converting a token to another token in the bancor network
    when the conversion cannot necessarily be done by single converter and might require multiple 'hops'.
    The path defines which converters should be used and what kind of conversion should be done in each step.

    The path format doesn't include complex structure and instead, it is represented by a single array
    in which each 'hop' is represented by a 2-tuple - smart token & to token.
    In addition, the first element is always the source token.
    The smart token is only used as a pointer to a converter (since converter addresses are more likely to change).

    Format:
    [source token, smart token, to token, smart token, to token...]
